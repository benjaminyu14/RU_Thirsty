2) Either choose your current location (which will prompt you to allow your location)
   OR navigate through the embedded Google Map to find a fountain in your area
3) Click on a water fountain marker to view / add a marker
   Viewing : The name of the marker and its location description will show
   Adding : Type in the location of the marker and include a description of how to find it
4) Click ok to accept or leave the marker tab
5) Find a water fountain and drink some water! 😀

To begin this project, some of my friends and I began to think of a problem that we may encounter at Rutgers, somehow we were always thirsty and looking for a water fountain. testtesttesttesttesttesttesttesttesttesttesttesttesttesttesttesttesttesttesttesttest

## 📚 Learnings:
It’s always good to note what you’ve learned, as that shows the project was a valuable endeavor. Building = learning.

## ✨ Improvement:
Nothing is perfect. Write down what could have been improved.

## 🚦 Running the Project:
If someone clones it, explain how they can run the project, which command lines need to be run, etc.

## 📸 Video or Image:
It’s always beneficial to showcase. Give them the result now instead of having them go to a website and then look for it.
